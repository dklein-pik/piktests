#' runWithComparison
#'
#' Starts two piktests runs, one with default packages and another one with renvInstallPackages installed, so they can
#' be compared. Run this to test changes in your fork by passing "<gituser>/<repo>" (e.g. "pfuehrlich-pik/madrat").
#' Use `piktests::comparePreprocessingLogs` for comparison after all runs are completed.
#'
#' @param renvInstallPackages Only in the second run, after installing
#' other packages, `renv::install(renvInstallPackages)` is called.
#' @param piktestsFolder A new folder is created in the given directory. In that folder two folders called "old"
#' and "new" are created which contain the actual piktests runs.
#' @param whatToRun A character vector defining what tests to run. See default value for a list of all possible tests.
#' @return Invisibly, the path to the folder holding the two actual piktests runs.
