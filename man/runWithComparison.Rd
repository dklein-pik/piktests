\arguments{
\item{renvInstallPackages}{Only in the second run, after installing
other packages, `renv::install(renvInstallPackages)` is called.}

\item{piktestsFolder}{A new folder is created in the given directory. In that folder two folders called "old"
and "new" are created which contain the actual piktests runs.}

\item{computationNames}{A subset of names(piktests::computations). The setup and compute functions of these
computations are executed.}

\item{diffTool}{One or more names of command line tools for comparing two text files. The first one that is found
via `Sys.which` is used in the comparison shell script. If none is found falls back to "diff".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{run}}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the path to the folder holding the two actual piktests runs.
}
\description{
Starts two piktests runs, one with default packages and another one with renvInstallPackages installed, so they can
be compared. Run this to test changes in your fork by passing "<gituser>/<repo>" (e.g. "pfuehrlich-pik/madrat").
Use the shell scripts created in the run folder to compare logs after all runs are finished.
