}
\arguments{
\item{renvInstallPackages}{Only in the second run, after installing
other packages, `renv::install(renvInstallPackages)` is called.}

\item{piktestsFolder}{A new folder is created in the given directory. In that folder two folders called "old"
and "new" are created which contain the actual piktests runs.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{run}}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the path to the folder holding the two actual piktests runs.
}
\description{
Starts two piktests runs, one with default packages and another one with renvInstallPackages installed, so they can
be compared. Run this to test changes in your fork by passing "<gituser>/<repo>" (e.g. "pfuehrlich-pik/madrat").
Use `piktests::comparePreprocessingLogs` for comparison after all runs are completed.
