\arguments{
\item{renvInstallPackages}{After installing other packages, renv::install(renvInstallPackages) is called.
Use this to test changes in your fork by passing "<gituser>/<repo>" (e.g. "pfuehrlich-pik/madrat").}

\item{piktestsFolder}{A new folder for this piktests run is created in the given directory.}

\item{whatToRun}{A character vector defining what tests to run. See default value for a list of all possible tests.}

\item{runFolder}{In general this should be left as default. Where the folder for this piktests run should be created.}

\item{runInNewRSession}{Exists for testing. A function like `callr::r` taking a function and arguments to execute
in a new R session.}
}

\description{
Runs integration tests in an isolated runtime environment.
}
\details{
A madratCacheFolder and a madratOutputFolder are created and used while running the tests. The non-public magpie
preprocessing repo `git@gitlab.pik-potsdam.de:landuse/preprocessing-magpie.git` is cloned, so you need access to it.
