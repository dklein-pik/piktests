\usage{
setupRenv(
  targetFolder,
  computationNames,
  renvInstallPackages,
  computationsSourceCode
)
}
\arguments{
\item{targetFolder}{Where to setup the renv.}

\item{computationNames}{A subset of names(piktests::computations). The setup functions of these computations are run.}

\item{renvInstallPackages}{renv::install(renvInstallPackages) is called. Use this to test changes in your fork
by passing "<gituser>/<repo>" (e.g. "pfuehrlich-pik/madrat").}

\item{computationsSourceCode}{A character vector containing the source code to create a list of computations
(see \code{\link{computations}}), usually `deparse(piktests::computations)`. Passing the computations like this has
two reasons: The environments associated with the functions in the computations are stripped. These associated
environments are only valid in the R session they originate from, but because setupRenv is run in a separate R
session they are invalid here. The other advantage is that setupRenv does not need to install piktests just to get
access to the computations.}
}
\description{
Sets up a fresh renv and installs the required packages in it.
}
\details{
This function should be called in a fresh R session (e.g. via callr::r), because setting up an renv involves
changing critical aspects of your R session like your libpaths.
